# Online Whiteboard

Online Whiteboard is an easy to use web application that acts as an online, interactive whiteboard in a room based session where meeting coordinators can annotate and draw on a virtual canvas with useful tools and attendees can watch and even draw with the coordinator upon permissions/modes. The virtual meeting sessions are controlled by a session owner and annotation permisssions can be provided to other users if needed.
